Part 1: The Theory (Concepts & Logic)
(Manam nerchukunna Concepts)

1. The Metric: IoU (Intersection over Union)
Definition: "The Judge" of object detection.
Formula:  
Union Area
Intersection Area
​	
 
Logic: Manam geesina box (Predicted) mariyu original box (Ground Truth) entha varaku overlap ayyayi (kalisi unnayi)?
Score:
0.5 to 1.0: Good / Excellent.
< 0.5: Bad detection.
2. YOLO (You Only Look Once)
The Concept: The "Speed King". It does not scan pixel-by-pixel. It splits the image into a Grid (S×S) and looks at the whole image at once.
Best For: Real-time tasks like Tollgates, Traffic, Self-Driving Cars.
Evolution: YOLOv1 (Fast but confused) → YOLOv8 (Fast & Accurate).
3. The "Dog vs. Lion" Problem (Occlusion)
The Question: "What if a Dog and a Lion are in the same grid cell?" (Rendu objects okari venuka okaru unte, YOLO ela gurthistundi?)
The Solution: Anchor Boxes.
YOLO doesn't just predict "One Box". It predicts multiple pre-defined shapes (Tall box, Wide box).
Dog matches the "Tall Box" anchor.
Lion matches the "Wide/Square Box" anchor.
Class Probability: Differentiates based on what the object looks like (Fur, Face, etc.).
4. Transformers (ViT & DETR)
ViT (Vision Transformer): Treats an image like a sentence. Cuts image into "Patches" (Words) and understands the relationship between them. (Slower, but smarter context).
DETR Flow: Image → CNN Backbone (Eyes) → Positional Encoding (GPS) → Transformer Encoder/Decoder (Brain) → FFN (Output).
Part 2: The Tools (Roboflow)
(Manam vadina Software tools)

1. What is Roboflow?
Analogy: "The Kitchen for Computer Vision."
Use:
Dataset: Storing images (Ingredients).
Annotate: Drawing boxes around cars/bikes (Cutting vegetables).
Train: Teaching the model (Cooking).
Deploy: Using the API (Serving the food).
2. Roboflow Universe
Definition: A public library where people share datasets.
For You: We found the "Indian Vehicle Dataset" here to train your model on Auto Rickshaws and Indian Trucks.
Part 3: The Practical (Coding & Errors)
(The Real Engineer Work - Errors manam fix chesinavi)

Step 1: The Setup (Environment)
The Error: Requires-Python <3.13.
Issue: Your Mac had Python 3.13 (too new). The library inference-sdk didn't work.
The Fix:
We installed Python 3.11 using Homebrew (brew install python@3.11).
We created a Virtual Environment (my_env) to keep things clean.
Step 2: The "Bad Image" Bug
The Error: Malformed base64 input image.
Issue: The image image.jpg was empty (0 bytes) because the download failed.
The Fix: We used the curl command to download a proper Bus image from GitHub.
Step 3: The Script (auto_detect.py)
This is the code we wrote to test the model.
Logic:
Load Image: Opens image.jpg.
API Call: Sends image + API_KEY to Roboflow servers.
Receive JSON: Gets a text reply: {"class": "bus", "confidence": 0.90, "x": 100, "y": 200...}.
Visualize: Uses OpenCV to draw a Green Box on the image.
Save: Saves the result as result_output.jpg.
Part 4: The Startup Application (Prometheus)
(Idi mee Startup ki ela use avtundi?)

You are building an Automated Tollgate. Here is the logic:
Input: CCTV Camera takes a photo of a vehicle.
Process: Your Python script runs the YOLO model.
JSON Logic:
Python
if class == "Ambulance":
    print("Open Gate - FREE")
elif class == "Car":
    print("Open Gate - Deduct ₹100")
elif class == "Truck":
    print("Open Gate - Deduct ₹200")
Action: The barrier lifts automatically.
